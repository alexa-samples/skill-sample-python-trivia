## What Your Skill Will Do
This simple "quiz" Skill will teach you how the different pieces of the Alexa Skill development process fit together. The Skill allows users to request a simple multiple choice trivia with 5 random questions about Reindeer.

We use will use the new Skill builder UI to build the Skill although the quiz itself does not employ the new "Dialog-Delegate interface" model.
